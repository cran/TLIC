Description: This comprehensive toolkit for T-distribution regression, known as the analysis of "TLIC" (T-distribution Linear regression Integrated Corrector), adopts ordinary least squares method and assumes that errors follow a T-distribution. This approach gives it an advantage when dealing with small samples or non-normal error distributions, and can provide more robust parameter estimation and hypothesis testing results.The philosophy of the package is described in Guo G. (2020) <doi:10.1080/02664763.2022.2053949>.
